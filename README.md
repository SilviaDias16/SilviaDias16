### Welcome to my portfolio!
I've been a Technical Author for more than 17 years now, and had the pleasure of working for some great companies in FinTech domain. My goal is to ensure that the documentation I create is easy to understand and meets customer needs.  
  
Since most of my work as been under non-disclosure agreement, I am unable to share the actual work samples. However, I've created some samples for my portfolio purpose, which will give you an idea of my writing and documenting skills.
